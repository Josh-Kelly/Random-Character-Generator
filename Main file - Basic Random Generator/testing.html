                            Few things have been more consistently controversial
                            in TTRPGs than Alignment. Telos aims to simplify and
                            clarify the mechanics and meaning of Alignment by,
                            to begin with, stating that few characters actually
                            <span class="csg-mark-strong">have </span>true
                            Alignment (at least at the start), and second that
                            there is an objective Good and an objective Evil in
                            Telos. While perspectives vary wildly on what is and
                            is not considered Good, mortal perceptions of these
                            have no bearing whatsoever on the Reality of them.
                          </p>

                            Alignment Traits are not simply a representation of
                            a character’s general outlook, they are
                            representative of deeply held beliefs that
                            consciously motivate a character’s activity and
                            habits: Authority, Autonomy, Chaos, Good,
                            Neutrality, and Evil. An Aligned character
                            understands the ideal, seeks to exemplify it in
                            herself, and molds her soul after it.

                            A character may be generally indifferent to the
                            suffering of others, but unless they specifically
                            and aggressively avoid entanglements with the
                            considerations of Good and Evil (e.g. Sapkowski’s
                            witchers: Kill monster, get paid, avoid everything
                            else), they should not possess the Neutral
                            (good/evil) Trait.

                            The best way to handle these alignments is for both
                            the DM and the players to maintain at all times the
                            understanding that

                            says “Evil Affinity,” T’han’Os will continue to
                            reach for Good, successfully invoke his Alignment,
                            and apply its effects to augment his efforts. What

                            <span class="csg-mark-strong">character</span> will
                            not realize is that he is actually invoking Evil.

                            Maintaining this distinction between what the player
                            knows and what the character knows can be conducive
                            to a moving campaign in which a character gradually
                            comes to understand that the actions he has always
                            considered good are actually Evil. This distinction
                            can do so while also avoiding (excessive) ethical
                            debate at the table. However, responsibly debating
                            ethics is a wonderful and beneficial activity and
                            frankly, if this game facilitates such an activity
                            at your table, I consider it a win.

                            Alignments are difficult to gain or lose because
                            they are deeply held beliefs that require a great
                            deal of thought, meditation, and deed to complete
                            the alignment of a soul to them.
                          </p>
                          <p class="csg-p">
                            To represent this fact, although the DM has full
                            authority in deciding when and how Alignments are
                            gained, an Alignment should only be initially gained
                            or finally lost through a moment of significant
                            roleplay: A towering moment in which a character
                            chooses to spare their father’s murderer who lies
                            helpless at their feet, allows the city to fall to
                            pieces, having despaired at the people’s inability
                            to come together, murders a child in pursuit of a
                            greater good, or abandons others to a terrible fate
                            by refusing to get involved.

                            Otherwise, the Alignment mechanic risks becoming a
                            gimmick which a player can pick up or lay down as it
                            is useful or inconvenient in their “build.” Unlike
                            Passions, redemption and corruption are always
                            possible, and Alignments can be gained or lost more
                            than once.

                            Increasing or decreasing an Alignment Maximum, on
                            the other hand, can be done through significant
                            investment during Downtime. As with Passions, the
                            player can describe the activity, the resources they
                            intend to expend, the sacrifices they intend to
                            make, and spend the Downtime Tokens. If the DM
                            agrees, the Alignment can increase or decrease by
                            whatever seems reasonable to the DM (usually just by
                            1 point per Downtime).

                            As in all things, the DM can alter these guidelines
                            to suit their own table, but should be aware that
                            doing so may complicate or conflict with other
                            rules, creatures, and adventures that have been
                            created with this system in mind.

                            I kind of like this idea, but it also seems like a
                            lot to keep track of. Maybe just have it only be
                            possible to have a single Alignment at a time…
